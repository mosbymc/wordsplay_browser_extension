    Set these values to change the minimum game time or words that are required for a single
    game's metrics to be recorded. NOTE: If you already have a tab open to the wordsplay.net
    site, you must refresh it for these options to take effect.
    <br><br>
    Minimum Game Time:
    The default minimum game time is 120 seconds, which means that
    from the time the 5 x 5 boggle game page is loaded, at least 2 minutes must remain on the clock
    for the extension to record the metrics. Because the extension must run on a timer that fires
    every few seconds, the maximum time you should enter is 175 second (2:55) and not 180 seconds
    because there's a good chance the timer won't pick up on the true start of the game.
    <br><br>
    Minimum Words:
    The default minimum game words is 1, which means that you must get at least one word in a game in order
    for the extension to recored the game's metrics. The value cannot be set to less than 1.
    <br><br>
    Game Timeout Length:
    The default value is 120 seconds, which means that if 120 or more second pass without at least one word
    being guessed by the player, then the game's metrics will not be recorded. This is to prevent a recording
    of the metrics during a game in which the player leaves or becomes distracted. The maximum value allowed
    is 180 and the minimum is value allowed is 20.
    <br><br>
    Both minimums are required to be met, not either/or. If the value provided cannot be parsed as an integer,
    or does not meet min/max criteria you will recieve an error message alerting you to the problem.
    <br><br>
    Clearing Game Metrics:
    Checking the checkboxes will clear all data associated with the specified game board size. After clicking
    submit, you can still come back to this options page and change the value before it takes effect as long as
    the wordsplay.net site has not been loaded or refreshed since they were changed. However, once the metrics
    are cleared, they cannot be regained.

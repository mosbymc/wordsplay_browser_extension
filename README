This is a cross-browser extension that records and displays metrics associated with the game found on http://www.wordsplay.net

Different metrics are recorded for the 4x4 game board and the 5x5 game board, and may be viewed by clicking the "B" logo
icon that appears in either the address bar of the browser, just outside of the address bar if using a Chromium-based
browser.

Both the minimum game time length and the minimum number of required words may be changed via the "options" page which
will change the minimum values required before the extension will record a given game's metrics. The default value for
the minimum game time is 120 seconds, so if the game board loads with less than 2 minutes on the "time remaining" clock,
the metrics will not be recorded for that particular game. The default value for the minimum game words is 1. This means
the extension will not record the metrics for a given game unless there has been at least one word guessed correctly.

You can also tell the application to delete any existing data for the 4x4 and 5x5 game boards individually within the
options page. Once a game board's data has been selected for removal, the data will only be deleted once you navigate to
the wordsplay website. Beforehand, the data still exists and the option to delete the data can be reverted without any
data loss if you return to the options page and de-select the game board's data-deletion option before loading the
wordsplay website.
